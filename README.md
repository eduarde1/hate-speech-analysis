# **Hate Speech Detection - Project**

Modern human communication is evolving faster than we are analyzing it, which has allowed small hate groups to connect with people that think similarly to them, making their ideas bigger than they really are, and resulting in polarization and hate speech.

This issue, even if it is clearly social, is a consequence of the development of the tech industry: the social media. So the problem must be analyzed from both points of view. The first step is to measure it and detect it, a job that can be done through Machine Learning. Then, the data output could be a great resource for social and psychological investigators.
